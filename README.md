My Graduation project

Me and my team were specifically selected by faculty dean to do this system to be deployed for the college warehouses.

I was responsible for Design, Implement and Deploy the backend part of the project including database architecture and overall design.

I used Spring Boot as a backend technology with PostgreSQL Database server.
